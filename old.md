How to setup python environment on Mac OS X Yosemite
=============

On this page I describe how to setup `python` environment on `Mac OS X Yosemite (10.10)`.


Know issues
----------

Now don't work some applications on OS X Yosemite:
- [Gmail doesn't work - Mail app crashes on Yosemite](https://miapple.me/fixing-mac-os-x-10-10-yosemite-gmail-bug-mail-app/). After update from Mavericks to Yosemite I have troubles with Mail app - it turned off after few seconds after launch. I have found this solution and it works well for me. Try it. It's easy and solve your problem. As I understand this problem appear if you have a lot of messages (1000+) into Gmail Inbox
- `mongodb` - was problem in Beta version of yosemite. In final version it was solved


HomeBrew
----------

Before you start, open `Terminal` application and install **Xcode command-line tool**. It's required to install a lot of software on your Mac.

```
xcode-select --install
```

Install [HomeBrew](http://brew.sh) to have ability to install up-to-date software, like `apt-get install` in `Ubuntu`.

My list of `brew` software (use `brew install [package_name]`):
- memcached
- mercurial
- git
- mysql
- postgresql
- mongodb
- rabbitmq
- node
- wget
- --- optional ---
- `zookeeper --with-python`
- `boost --with-python`
- lynx
- cairo
- jpeg
- jsoncpp
- gettext
- glib
- libpng
- log4cpp


System changes
----------

Edit `nano ~/.profile` file to have this lines:

```
# load all completions
source /usr/local/etc/bash_completion.d/*
# load virtual env wrapper
source virtualenvwrapper.sh
# Set architecture flags
export ARCHFLAGS="-arch x86_64"
# Ensure user-installed binaries take precedence
export PATH=/usr/local/bin:$PATH
# Load .bashrc if it exists
test -f ~/.bashrc && source ~/.bashrc
```

Press `Cmd + O` to save file, `Cmd + X` to exit from nano. Run this command in terminal `source ~/.profile` to load changes.

Edit `~/.hgrc` and insert info about my user:

```
[ui]
username = User Name <user@gmail.com>
```


Python tools
----------

- `brew install python` installs `python` and `pip`
- `pip install virtualenv`
- `pip install virtualenvwrapper`


### Django completion

Add autocompletion in terminal when we type `manage.py` or `django-admin.py` and press `<tab>` key two times

- `cd /usr/local/etc/bash_completion.d/`
- `wget https://raw.github.com/django/django/master/extras/django_bash_completion`
- `source ~/.profile` to affect changes


Post-installation
----------

- create virtual environments for projects `mkvirtualenv [env_name]` and run `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- restore MySQL databases
- restore mongodb collections: 1. `mongodump --out backup/` 2. `mongorestore backup/`
